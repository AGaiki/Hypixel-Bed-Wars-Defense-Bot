# Hypixel Bed Wars Defense Assignment Bot
This is a simple Discord bot that assigns chief and backup defenders for a Bed Wars game on Hypixel based on predetermined assignments based on maps. However, it also has a functionality which allows for random assignments of defenders if needed. This application comes in two "flavors," [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

# Installation - Python Edition
Make sure you have Python 3.8 installed from either python.org or the Microsoft Store. For some reason, the Microsoft Store edition of Python has given me more success than the python.org version, but you can figure out what you want to use. The commands are the same, so no matter what edition you have, you should be able to run it successfully
